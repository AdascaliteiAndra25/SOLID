"# SolidPrinciples" 
This project demonstrates the correction of an existing code to comply with the SOLID principles. Each principle is illustrated with examples of incorrect and correct code. I have implemented and improved the code to properly apply the SOLID principles, thereby enhancing the structure and maintainability of the application.
